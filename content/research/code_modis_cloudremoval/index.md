Some python script to apply spatial and temporal filters (also in succession) in order to remove clouds in Eurac's binary snow maps. The code is available on gitlab at [https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/earth_observation_public/modis_snow_cloud_removal](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/earth_observation_public/modis_snow_cloud_removal).

See also the associated [paper](/research/paper_data_modis/), which gives an overview of the cloud removal procedures, and the [dataset](/research/data_modis_cloudremoval/).
