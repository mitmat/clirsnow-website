Every year, Eurac hosts the Marie-Curie-Week helping applicants prepare their proposal for an individual fellowship (MSCA-IF).

Because of Covid-19, the Marie-Curie-Week 2020 was held in a virtual format, compared to the [previous year](/communication/msc-week-2019/) with in-person meetings. Nonetheless, we fellows could help future applicants in a dedicated Q&A session.

Information on the current MSC-week programme can be found at [http://www.eurac.edu/msc-week](http://www.eurac.edu/msc-week).
