I'm happy that my former colleague [Peter](/author/peter-james-zellner/) decided to feature CliRSnow as prime example of Open Science in a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) on EO (Earth Observation). This because CliRSnow embodies all elements from open science, like creating open packages for data analysis, putting code online for reproducibility, and hosting results and data on open platforms like Zenodo. 

The MOOC is available at eo-college.org and is called [Cubes & Clouds](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds/).
