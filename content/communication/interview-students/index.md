title: "High school students interview climate scientists"
---

Four students (two locals, two exchange students from the Netherlands) arrived from Bressanone to interview Alice and me on climate change in South Tyrol. They were preparing a paper project, and wanted some scientific advice on climate change topics in general, and more concretely in South Tyrol. Alice prepared some slides, and we hosted a little Q&A session.
