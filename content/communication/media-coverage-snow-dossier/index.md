The snow dossier (see [here](/communication/media-coverage-snow-dossier) for more info) received some coverage, mostly in the region (South Tyrolean) news and generally in Italy. 

A comprehensive press review as of the 11th of March, created by Eurac Communications, can be {{% staticref "/pdf/2021-03-11-PressReview_snow_dossier.pdf" "newtab" %}}downloaded as PDF{{% /staticref %}}.

It has been followed up by some interviews:

- *Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung* {{% staticref "/pdf/2021-03-12-Südtiroler-Wirtschaftszeitung-Die-Vermessung-des-Winters.pdf" "newtab" %}}(PDF of article){{% /staticref %}}
- *Alto Adige* (see [here](https://www.eurac.edu/it/magazine/michael-matiu-cambiamenti-climatici-neve) for an online version of the printed article).
- Giacomo (co-author of the dossier) was interviewed by Federico Zappini from Trento.


The dossier led to a collaboration with a Bachelor student from TH Rosenheim, which is using snow as theme for furniture dewsign.
