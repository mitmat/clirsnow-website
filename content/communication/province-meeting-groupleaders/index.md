title: "Institute heads and group leaders meet representatives from the province"
---

The institutes heads and group leaders met virtually with representatives of the province of Bolzano. What was planned as an institute event, had to be re-organized because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The focus of the meeting was to identify key interests of the local stakeholders in science topics covered by the institute. Alice and I prepared the part on Climate Services that were developed in the last years at the institute and in course of the fellowship.
