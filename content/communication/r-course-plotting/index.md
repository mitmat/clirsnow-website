After long time of Covid-19 induced delays, we were finally able to do our course on advanced plotting in R as an Eurac internal seminar - in presence.

All the material, slides, codes, and exercises are available [online](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/rmeetupbz/plottingr_2021/).

Thanks to M. Rossi and G. Genova, with whom I did the course, and to all participants!
