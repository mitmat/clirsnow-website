The Eurac communication department developed this e-learning course for high school students (age 14+) based on the content from the [snow dossier](/communication/snow-dossier/) with additional input from other colleagues (M. Callegari, R. Barella, C. Notarnicola) working on ice and glaciers.

The course is free of charge and available in [English](https://e-learning.eurac.edu/en/snow-and-ice/#/), [German](https://e-learning.eurac.edu/de/schnee-und-eis/#/), and [Italian](https://e-learning.eurac.edu/it/neve-e-ghiaccio/#/).
