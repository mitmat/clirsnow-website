Every year, Eurac hosts the Marie-Curie-Week helping applicants prepare their proposal for an individual fellowship (MSCA-IF).

I myself have participated 2017, and thanks to the great support of Eurac, we came up with a succesful proposal.

Here, current fellows hold a Q&A session with participants in 2019. The current fellows are Yonatan Fessha, Bianca Elzenbaumer, and myself, Michael Matiu, all acting as Marie-Curie-Ambassadors.

Information on the current MSC-week programme can be found at [http://www.eurac.edu/msc-week](http://www.eurac.edu/msc-week).
