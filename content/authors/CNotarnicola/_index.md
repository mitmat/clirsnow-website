Claudia Notarnicola has a Masterâ€™s Degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Physics. In the institute, she is leader of a group dealing with remote sensing applications in SAR and optical domain for soil, vegetation and snow monitoring as well as integration of remotely sensed observations with models and ground measurements. Her main research interest includes biophysical parameters (soil moisture, vegetation, snow) retrieval by using optical images and SAR images, optical and SAR data processing, data fusion and electromagnetic models. She conducts research on these topics within the frameworks of several national and international projects (e.g., CRYOMON, ECOPOTENTIAL, PROSNOW, SECLI-FIRM). As part of the Cassini RADAR Team, she has received the NASA Group Achievement Award, in 2009. Since 2006, she is the chair of the SPIE Conference, Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental
Monitoring. She has co-authored more than 60 papers in international peer-reviewed journals. In the last 6 years, she has been supervising 5 PhD students.
